    <description>BinInfo gets information about Credit Card Issuers through binlist.net public REST API.

binlist.net is a public web service for searching Issuer Identification Numbers (IIN).

The first 6 digits of a credit card number are known as the Issuer Identification Number (IIN), previously known as Bank Identification Number (BIN). These identify the institution that issued the card to the card holder.

This webservice has an internal database with IIN/BIN information, which is queried via the Rest API. There's no magic or tricky calculations, it's just a database. And although the database is very accurate, don't expect it to be perfect.</description>
